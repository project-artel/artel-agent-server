# Project Context

Fill this document during project initialization. Agents must verify commands against repository configuration before running them.

## Overview

- Product: artel-agent-server
- Primary users: Backend services and operators that request AI agent workflows.
- Core domain: AI agent orchestration server for scenario generation, QA execution, and bug report workflows.
- Runtime environment: Python 3.11+ FastAPI application.

## Architecture

- Entry points: `app.main:create_app`, `app.main:app`
- Main modules: `app/api`, `app/llm`
- Dependency direction: API routes stay thin; LLM provider clients depend on shared LLM schemas and configuration.
- External systems: GitHub repository `project-artel/artel-agent-server`; Notion workspace via the `ntn` CLI
- Persistent data: None yet.

## Commands

| Purpose | Command |
|---|---|
| Install dependencies | `python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"` |
| Run locally | `python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload` |
| Format | TODO |
| Lint | TODO |
| Type-check | TODO |
| Unit tests | `python -m pytest` |
| Integration tests | TODO |
| Build | TODO |
| Install Notion CLI | `curl -fsSL https://ntn.dev \| bash` |
| Verify Notion CLI auth | `ntn whoami` |

Notion access goes through the `ntn` CLI. Agents follow
`.agents/skills/notion-cli/SKILL.md`, which Claude Code reaches at
`.claude/skills/notion-cli` through the repository-level `.claude` symlink.

Authenticate with a token rather than `ntn login`: export `NOTION_API_TOKEN`
from your shell profile, using a token issued at
`https://www.notion.so/profile/integrations`. The integration must be connected
to each page and data source it needs, otherwise reads return 404. Never commit
the token.

Write operations (`ntn pages create`, `ntn files create`, `ntn workers deploy`)
are not pre-approved and require explicit confirmation.

## Constraints

- Supported platforms: Windows development environment; Linux deployment target not defined yet.
- Compatibility requirements: Python 3.11 or newer.
- Performance constraints: TODO
- Security or privacy requirements: External LLM credentials must be provided through environment/configuration, not committed.

## Ownership

- Sensitive modules:
